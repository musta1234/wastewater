Calculation figures Sewage measurements COVID-19
In collaboration with the water boards, Statistics Netherlands has the number of affiliated residents per
Sewage treatment plant (WWTP) mapped. The number of inhabitants per location for 2022
can be found in the following table of Statistics Netherlands (the version for 2021 can be found here). Because there
During these years have been changes in a few measuring locations, the population of inhabitants apply
For a certain period, indicated by a start and end date in the Tabelle

Also stands in
This table per location and per period of the ratio from which safety regions and municipalities
The sewage is from. This enables the RIVM to do the number of virus particles per 100,000
to calculate residents and attribute them in the right proportions to connected
Safety regions and municipalities. (*)


Municipal figures:
The calculation takes place at municipal level based on weekly averages. As above
described, the measurement points of individual locations are weighed to the number of connected
Residents per municipality in the calculation of the averages.

Weekly average municipal level:
The weekly average is calculated by first per WWTP the average of all measured values
to calculate in that week. After that, the weekly average is calculated at municipal level
About all corresponding measuring locations. The averages are weighed per measuring locations
To the amount of people in the municipalities who discharge at the relevant measuring locations (**). The
Weeks walk from Monday to Sunday. The average for the last week is calculated on
the following
The average for the last week is calculated on
The following Tuesday. If there is no measurement for a location in a certain week
Being known, then it is not included in the calculation.

Description method:
- multiply the number of affiliated residents with the share per location at the
Municipality hears (**). We now call this the value (x) of the location.
- Share the weekly average per location by 100,000.
- multiply this by (x).
- summon all these values of the locations in question.
- Share this by the summarized total of all (x) values of the locations in question.
- Multiply the end result by 100,000.


National and safety regions:
At national and safety region level, average daily values based on the last
Well -known values of the WWTPs calculated. The measurement points of individual locations are
weighted to the number of affiliated residents in the calculation of the averages.
A last known value on a day X is determined by the most recent per measuring location
measurement, viewed from (and inclusive) day X. As a measurement more than 8 days before day
X is, then Ti counts

If a measurement more than 8 days before day
X is, then that value and location does not count in the calculation of the day average.
Description Method National Day averages:
- Share the last known value per location by 100,000.
- Multiply this by the number of affiliated residents per location. (***)
- Summarize all these values of the different locations.
- Share this by the sum of all affiliated residents of the locations.
- Multiply the end result by 100,000.

Note: it can happen that measurement values will be made at a later time
Made from previous days, from last week, or even the weeks before. That is why it becomes
Open data file daily. The day and weekly averages are hereby
recalculated. Any corrections will be made in previous weeks. The
measured values per individual location are in the graph on the Corona dashboard on the date
on which the measurement was performed. On the Corona Dashboard

The
measured values per individual location are in the graph on the Corona dashboard on the date
on which the measurement was performed. On the Corona Dashboard, day averages are shown to
and on the day on which the most recent virus freight is reported in the open data of the
RIVM.

(*) De CBS 2021 tabel is (met terugwerkende kracht) toegepast op de metingen die gedaan zijn in 
2020. In de week van 5 oktober is RWZI Aalst door RWZI Zaltbommel overgenomen, en in de 
week van 7 december is RWZI Lienden door RWZI Tiel overgenomen. Hierdoor wordt vóór deze 
weken met een verlaagd inwonersaantal gerekend voor locatie Zaltbommel en Tiel. Deze 
aantallen, en die van Aalst en Lienden, zijn te vinden in de 2020 versie van de tabel van het CBS.

(**) In the calculation at municipal level, the number of affiliated residents for a location
and the share of the municipality in the location determined by the first Monday of the week
take for which the weekly average is determined.

(***) In the calculation at the national and safety region level, the number is connected
residents for a location and share of the safety region in the location determined by the day
on which it was last measured.

Extensive calculation example for 2021:
The municipality of Gorinchem is affiliated with WWTP Gorinchem and WWTP Schelluinen. These
18680 and 44862 affiliated residents respectively. We get the following from the CBS table
Information: The municipality of Gorinchem uses 83.30% and 48.70% of the respectively
capacity of these installations. The number of inhabitants per municipality per WWTP, the aforementioned
Number "X", is for these locations:

X - WWTP Gorinchem: .8330 * 18680 = 15560
X - WWTWI Schelluinen: .4870 * 44862 = 21848
(Apart from completion differences).
For the calculation at municipal level in, for example, week 40, we are now taking the
weekly average virus freight value at WWTP Gorinchem, which consists of 3 measurements, of 4, 5 and
October 10. This average comes out on (rounded) 1,56383E+13 virus particles per 100,000
inhabitants. For Schelluinen, the weekly average is 2,25259e+13 virus particles per 100,000
inhabitants. We share these figures

We divide these figures by 100,000 to end up on the virus freight per person.
By multiplying this weekly average virus freight per person by their respective
Number "X", the number of inhabitants per municipality per WWTP, we get:
WWTP Gorinchem: 1,56383E+9 * 15560 = 2,43331E+12 virus particles
WWTP Schelluinen: 2,25259e+9 * 21848 = 4,92147e+12 virus particles

We count these values together and then we divide through the total number of people
Connected is:
(2,43331E+12+4.92147E+12) / (15560+21848) = 1.97E+8 virus particles per person
This is the number of virus particles per person in the municipality of Gorinchem.
We then multiply this by 100,000, to come out on
1.97th+13 virus particles per 100,000 inhabitants,
The number stated on the dashboard.

(Note: In case there were no measurement of one of the WWTPs in the week, then
the inhabitants of that WWTP are also not included in the calculation. In the above
case, in the absence of WWTP Schelluinen, the calculation would be 1.56th+13
virus particles per 100,000 inhabitants, equal to the weekly average of WWTP Gorinchem)
